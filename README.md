# Node-RED intermediate for LLE HTTP API and OPC-UA

To get started, run in the shell from the repository root directory:

```shell
$ docker compose up
```
 and open http://localhost:1880 in your browser. 
 
 The flows are in the `data/flows.json` file. You might need to change endpoints of your LLE API and OPC-UA server. So, please, check all the URLs first before deploying the flows.
